## Preliminaries: Slides and Transcript

You will find the slides and sources for both the full length and lightning
talk version of this talk along with a transcript
[here](https://btw23.de/johannes/talks/magnum-debugging-101.tar.bz2).

You do not need to remember these URLs now. We will display a shortened URL and
